# MTGAP

Having tried different keyboard layouts lately, namely

- QWERTY,
- Colemak,
- Dvorak,
- Colemak-DH

I was still looking for alternatives and reading in a couple of forums.

One layout that managed to do well, or rather, stand out, in all the different keyboard layout analyzers I tried is the (hopefully) [latest version of MTGAP's layout](https://mathematicalmulticore.wordpress.com/the-keyboard-layout-project/).
I am currently learning the version that optimizes the 30 main keys on a standard (ISO or ANSI) keyboard, and so far I'm very impressed. It is a very roll-heavy layout with a good amout of alternation and feels very smooth overall.

Since I am currently using macOS, Windows 10, Arch Linux and Debian simultaneously, I implemented the 30-key version of MTGAP for those systems. The Linux version needs some tweaking still and is hopefully going to be uploaded soon.
